# MCKVRP

### Features already implemented in jsprit:
- time windows
- capacities on vehicles
- multiple depots
- infinite vs finite fleets
- heterogeneous fleet (variable costs for different vehicles)
- depot visits




- break for drivers?
- route seeds?




### Features we will need to add:
- lateness penalty
- different speeds for different vehicles
- service time
- "snap" points to road network
- reward for delivery
- time/distance savings (comparing to baseline, so saving/loading routes as well)
- choose which to minimize: distance, time, or overall cost (usually time)
- capacities on depots

- max number of vehicles? (finite at a certain point?)


### Features that would be cool:
- curb issue
- automate execution (keeping map and depots the same)


#### Approximate time:
2-3 minutes for 200 points, 1 truck
